# üê¶ Bird Migration Exploratory Data Analysis

A comprehensive, step-by-step analysis of a synthetic bird migration dataset (10,000 records, 40+ features) to uncover flight behaviors, environmental influences, seasonal rhythms, and migratory success patterns. This project demonstrates advanced EDA techniques‚Äîdata cleaning, statistical plots, geospatial mapping, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and focused deep dives.

## üìñ Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Uncover core migratory strategies and environmental dependencies in a global, synthetic bird tracking dataset. We explore:

- Flight metrics (distance, duration, speed, altitude)  
- Environmental factors (weather, temperature, humidity)  
- Temporal patterns (spring vs. fall migrations)  
- Outcomes (success vs. interruption)  
- Behavioral clusters (distinct migration strategies)

**Why Synthetic Data?**  
Privacy-safe, fully-synthetic yet realistic records allow unrestricted exploration and portfolio showcase without ethical constraints.

## üöÄ Analysis Workflow & Inferences

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation & Cleaning  
- **Load & Inspect:** Examined `df.info()`, missing values, data types.  
- **Handle Missing ‚ÄúInterrupted_Reason‚Äù:** ~10% NaNs ‚Üí filled with `"Unknown"` to preserve all records.  
- **Convert Columns:** Month fields to ordered categories, key fields to `category` dtype.  
- **Inference:** After cleaning, the dataset is fully populated and correctly typed, enabling robust downstream analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Univariate & Bivariate Exploration  
- **Univariate:**  
  - **Species Counts:** No single dominating species‚Äî‚ÄúOther‚Äù category comprises 71%.  
  - **Flight Distance & Duration:** Right-skewed distributions; most flights cluster around 2,000‚Äì3,000 km and 40‚Äì60 h.  
  - **Weather Conditions:** ‚ÄúFoggy‚Äù and ‚ÄúStormy‚Äù dominate (each ~20%).  

- **Bivariate:**  
  - **Distance vs. Speed (Scatter):** Weak positive correlation‚Äîlonger trips tend to be slightly faster on average.  
  - **Distance by Region (Boxplot):** North/South America flights slightly longer median than Europe/Africa.  
  - **Altitude by Weather (Boxplot):** Clear conditions permit highest altitudes; storms force lower ceilings.  
  - **Nesting Success by Habitat:** Wetlands & grasslands show marginally higher success rates.  

- **Inference:** Basic distributions align with ecological expectations: adverse weather constrains altitude; habitat influences nesting success; flight characteristics vary modestly by region.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Geospatial Mapping  
- **Plotly Routes:** Sampled 500 birds; thick, semi-opaque lines on light-gray land highlight colorful species-coded tracks.  
- **Folium Interactive Map:** Overlay of 200 trajectories with hoverable start/end markers.  

- **Inference:** Migration corridors are global‚Äîtranspolar flights in spring, intercontinental return paths in fall. Visual clarity accentuates species ranges and migration breadth.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ PCA & Clustering  
- **Standardization:** Scaled 16 numeric features.  
- **PCA:**  
  - **PC1 (6.5% variance):** Dominated by flight duration (0.39) and distance (0.33).  
  - **PC2 (6.4% variance):** Driven by temperature (0.34), min altitude (0.34), visibility (0.32), with negative loadings on max altitude and rest stops.  
- **K-Means (k=4):** Identified four migration strategy clusters:  
  1. **Cluster 0:** Long, high-altitude flights with moderate stops  
  2. **Cluster 1:** Longest distances + heavy rest-stop behavior  
  3. **Cluster 2:** Shortest, fastest, large-flock migrations  
  4. **Cluster 3:** Mid-range opportunistic flyers  

- **Inference:** The low variance explained by first two PCs indicates a need for multiple components to capture complexity; clustering in PCA space revealed coherent behavioral types.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonal & Time-Based Patterns  
- **Migration Counts by Month:**  
  - Bi-modal peaks: **spring** (Jan‚ÄìMay, peak in Mar‚ÄìApr) and **fall** (Sep‚ÄìNov, peak in Oct).  
  - Virtually no migrations in June‚ÄìAug or December.  
  - **Cluster nuances:** Cluster 0 peaks earlier in spring; Cluster 2 maintains a robust autumn presence.  

- **Flight Duration & Distance by Month & Cluster:**  
  - **Duration:** Cluster 0 highest (55‚Äì62 h), Cluster 1 next (52‚Äì60 h), Cluster 3 mid (45‚Äì54 h), Cluster 2 lowest (45‚Äì50 h). Spring variability > Fall consistency.  
  - **Distance:** Cluster 1 longest (2,700‚Äì2,800 km), Cluster 0 (2,500‚Äì2,650 km), Cluster 3 (2,300‚Äì2,450 km), Cluster 2 shortest (2,200‚Äì2,350 km).  

- **Inference:** Behavioral clusters maintain signature flight profiles regardless of exact start month; spring migrations exhibit greater variation, while fall returns are more uniform.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Categorical Cross-Tabs & Heatmaps  
- **Success by Habitat:**  
  - **Wetlands** highest success (52.3%), **coastal** (~51.8%), **grassland** (~51.7%).  
  - **Mountains** lowest (~48% success).  
- **Interruption by Weather:**  
  - **Windy** most interruptive (50.5%), followed by storms/fog (~50.3%).  
  - **Rainy** slightly less disruptive (50.2%).  

- **Inference:** Routes through wetlands/coasts favor successful completion; mountainous terrain poses challenges. High winds slightly increase interruption risk more than storms or fog.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster 2 Deep-Dive  
- **Habitat Mix:** Urban (~17%), Wetland (~17%), Grassland (~17%), Mountain (~16%), Coastal (~16%), Forest (~17%)  
- **Weather Mix:** Foggy (~21%), Windy (~21%), Clear/Stormy (~20%), Rainy (~18%)  
- **Success Rate:** 51.1% successful vs. 48.9% failed  

- **Inference:** Cluster 2‚Äôs fast-flock strategy operates under diverse environments and weather but achieves only average success‚Äîflocking speeds flight but doesn‚Äôt markedly improve outcomes.
